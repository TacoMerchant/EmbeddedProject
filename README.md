Final Project

List of things to do:
	1) Need to connect all of the files, test UART, test PWM.
	2) Need to add ADC files.
	3) Need to modify os.c and rtos_user.c by changing the body of threads (there are four right now) and their priorities. This is a very simple round robin, priority RTOS. 
		Right now those 4 threads simply toggle LEDs.
